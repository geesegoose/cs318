            Pikachu (Japanese: ピカチュウ Pikachu) is an Electric-type Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Pichu when leveled
            up with high friendship and evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone. However, the starter Pikachu
            in Pokémon Yellow will refuse to evolve into Raichu unless it is traded and evolved on another save file

            Chiko (Japanese: チコ Chico) is a Pokémon in the romantic manga series Magical Pokémon Journey. Chiko is friends with Bulbasaur.
            When Chiko was first introduced, she fell in love with Pistachio and caused a fight and a competition with Bulbasaur.
            However, after she saw Pistachio trying to cheer up Bulbasaur when she lost, she apologized and the two Pokémon
            became close friends. She often talks in the third person. Later, she develops a crush on Charmander.

        <p>
            Kyurem (Japanese: キュレム Kyurem) is a dual-type Dragon/Ice Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation V. While it is not known
            to evolve into or from any Pokémon, it has two other forms, which are activated by using the DNA Splicers on
            it and either Reshiram or Zekrom, resulting in a process called Absofusion that removes Reshiram or Zekrom from
            the party until the fusion is undone. It will then become White Kyurem (with Reshiram) or Black Kyurem (with
            Zekrom). However, it is impossible to own a White Kyurem and a Black Kyurem at the same time legitimately, as
            the game rejects the second fusion of Kyurem with Reshiram/Zekrom, and Kyurem cannot be traded or placed in Pokemon
            Bank while fused.
