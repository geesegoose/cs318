    <h1>My Favorie Quotations</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Raoul Duke</b> in <i>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</i></li>
        <blockquote>No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind. Buy the ticket, take the ride...and if it occasionally gets a little heavier than what you had in mind, well...maybe chalk it up to forced consciousness expansion: Tune in, freak out, get beaten.</blockquote>
        <li><b>Skullduggery Pleasant</b>in <i>Skullduggery Pleasant</i></li>
        <blockquote>There’s no such thing as winning or losing. There is won and there is lost, there is victory and defeat. There are absolutes. Everything in between is still left to fight for. Serpine will have won only when there is no one left to stand against him. Until then, there is only the struggle, because tides do what tides do–they turn.</blockquote>
        <li><b>Newt Scamander</b> in <i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i></li>
        <blockquote>Sorry. We call them Muggles.</blockquote>
