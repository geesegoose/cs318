    <div class="pagename">Welcome to Narrows Creek Winery,
      <p class="left">We are located 1 mile north of Loganville, WI. It’s not just about our love of wine…it’s about the people we’ll meet.
        Come meet Dean &amp; Vicky and enjoy a glass of wine and the views of the countryside at our intimate winery. Narrows
        Creek Winery is a fruit winery that opened in September 2017.

          alt="pusheen" id="right"> We opened for the 2018 season on April 6, 2018. Days / Hours for the winery may vary throughout the year. At this
        time we are open FRI-SAT 11-6 &amp; SUN 12-6 each week. Narrows Creek Wines are a variety of fruit wines gathered
        throughout the state. Some are produced on site and some will be grown on site in the future. Some fruits are gathered
        from other farmers in the area. We are always trying something new at the winery. Because we are a fledgling winery
        we can only grow with wines and events and structure as we embark on this journey. Narrows Creek Winery also invites
        you to try wine making with us. We are a winery that believes in teaching as well as experiencing the wines we create.
