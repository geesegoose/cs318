  <p class="left">Come make your own wine here at our winery. Dean and Vicky Baumgarten, your winemakers, would like to share their knowledge
    of making wine and assist you in producing your own wine at the winery. Choose from our many varieties of wine kits we
    offer at Narrows Creek Winery. The cost of a kit starts at $200 on up. A kit will yield approximately 6 gallons or approximately
    28 - 750ml bottles of wine.</p>
  <ul class="kit">
    <li>Pick your kit from our catalog.</li>
    <li>Set a date to start your wine. The timeline is usually 4-6 weeks from start to finish.</li>
    <li>Start your wine and learn about some of the wine additives used to ensure a quality product.</li>
    <li> (Optional) Follow up with additional steps during fermentation of your wine.  </li>
    <li>(Mandatory) Bottle your wine and take it home.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="left">Kits range from $200 - $250 This price includes corks and sleeves and DOES NOT include tax or items below.

  </p>
  <ul class="kit">
    <li>*Bottles need to be those that housed a cork previously. You would need approximately 30 bottles. They need to be clean
      and free of labels. We do offer reused bottles from the winery when they are available for $.50 / bottle.</li>
    <li>*Filtering ($10) is at the discretion of the customer. Most times the wine additives do the work and filtering is seldom
      needed.
