    <br>
    <br><strong>Hill and Valley Exploration Tour</strong>
    <br>
    <br>Occurring on the first two full weekends in October, the Hill and Valley Exploration
    Tour: A Celebration of Rural Living is a unique opportunity to explore the beautiful hills and valleys, view the fall
    colors, shop the fall harvest at rural farms, restaurants and businesses, and learn about the vibrant small farm economy
    of Northern Sauk and Richland Counties! Prepare yourself to explore and experience farm and rural living first hand!
    Feed the calves. Walk the fields. Harvest honey. Create beautiful farm arts and crafts. Take a hay wagon ride with beautiful
    vistas. Learn about farming. Visit folk art sites. Find vintage treasures. Share history with your neighbors. And there's
    so much more! Don't forget to bring your mud boots and an extra sweater. Grab the cooler to fill with farm fresh meats,
    cheeses, honey, preserves and veggies. It is good ole country-style fun--rain or shine! Come and join the fun! Narrows
    Creek Winery is a participant in the Hill and Valley Exploration Tour.</p>
