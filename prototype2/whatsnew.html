  <p class="left">We have just recently opened for the new year. We were closed for the months of Jan – Mar to just make wine. Our opening
    in September of 2017 was a great start to this journey we have taken. We were well received by the public and hope to
    be able to introduce different events during the year.
    <br>
    <br>Wine is being produced throughout the year as new fruits become
    available. The tanks have Summer Tea, Cranberry Raisin, Summer Citrus and Rhubarb Raspberry. We will be making another
    tank of Blueberry Concord and Summer Tea before the Rhubarb season is in full swing. We invited friends to help bottle
    one of the many tanks.
    <br>
    <br>WANTED: Rhubarb. We are reaching out to all who have a Rhubarb patch in their yard. Anyone having
    more Rhubarb than they can use, we would be most grateful if you would let us pick some of your Rhubarb. We collected
    a TON of Rhubarb from neighbors last year. Then we went to MI to purchase a HALF TON so we would have the Rhubarb wines
    when we opened in April. Our goal is HUGE as we would like to collect 4 TON by season’s end this year. WE NEED YOU. </p>
