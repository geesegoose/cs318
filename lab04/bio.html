            <p>It was mating season in '03.</p>
            <p>Greg was searching for his mate,</p>
            <p>Where, out of now where.  Greg heard other males bellowing their call.</p>
            <img src="" alt="The Gang Back in the Day">
            <p>Greg met up with his potential mate, but there were 2 other male moose and one man.</p>
            <p>The man was immitating a female moose, for he was hunting and seeking to draw a male to his location to kill.</p>
            <p>The man and the other moose seemed to be in perfect harmony with their calls</p>
            <p>The man and the 3 moose decided to form an A cappella band</p>
            <p>But man and the other 2 moose developed a nasty habit of smoking pine needles and eating poison ivy</p>
            <p>A fight broke out...</p>
            <p>Now it's just Mooseman all by his lonesome</p>
