                <p>One issue, which troubles me, I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends. 
                    You know why I do this. I want security for my family. 
                    No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio?
                    Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one.
                    But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up. 
                    I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. </p>

                <p>It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive? 

                        That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it.
                        We made a deal. That's right.
                        Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding.
                        Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week.
                        That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound. 
                        Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try.
                        This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch.
                        And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we're dead.
                        There's no more room for error. Not with these people</p>
