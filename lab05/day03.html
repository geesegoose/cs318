                <p>You're his cook now. You're the cook and you have proven that you can run a lab without me and now that cook has reason to kill me.
                    Think about it! It's brilliant. So go ahead. If you think that I am capable of doing this, then go ahead. Put a bullet, in my head, and kill me right now.
                    DO IT! Do it. Do it. Do it.
                    He'll live. I asked to see you in order to... clear the air.
                    There are uh, some... issues that could cause a misunderstanding between us and I think it's in our best interest to lay the cards on the table.
                    My brother-in-law, moments before he was attacked, someone called to warn him.
                    I believe that same person was protecting me.</p>

                <p>Those two men, the assassins. I believe I was their prime target, but that somehow they were steered away from me to my brother-in-law. Because of this 'intervention' I am alive.
                    And yet, I think that this person was playing a much deeper game. He made that phone call because he wanted a shootout not a silent assassination. 
                     In one stroke, he bloodied both sides - set the American and Mexican governments against the Cartel, and cut off the supply of methamphetamine to the southwest.
                     If this man had his own source of product on this side of the border, he would have the market to himself.
                    The rewards would be... enormous.
                    We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion.
                    I know I owe you my life. And more than that, I respect the strategy.
                    In your position, I would have done the same.</p>
