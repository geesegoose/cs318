            <li>Heat oven to 425°F. Make pie crusts as directed on box for Two-Crust Pie using 9-inch glass pie pan.</li>
            <li> In 2-quart saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add onion; cook 2 minutes, stirring frequently, until tender.
                Stir in flour, salt and pepper until well blended. Gradually stir in broth and milk, cooking and stirring
                until bubbly and thickened.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken and mixed vegetables. Remove from heat. Spoon chicken mixture into crust-lined pan. Top with
                second crust; seal edge and flute. Cut slits in several places in top crust.</li>
