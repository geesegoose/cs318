            <p>Question 1: Search the web to learn the purpose of DOCTYPE. Explain its purpose in our own words.</p>
            <p>Question 2: What happens when you omit the doctype? What is the name of the mode that the browser enters? (It starts with a Q)</p>
            <p>Question 3: What happens when you place two HTML elements as siblings? By siblings I mean two elements sit at the same level of the hierarchy. One opens right after the other one closes.</p>
            <p>Question 4: What is currently displayed in your browser's tab when viewing answers.html?</p>
            <p>Question 5: How does the browser handle the second body element?</p>
