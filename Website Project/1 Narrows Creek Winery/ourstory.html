    <blockquote> We have been making wine for over 30 years as a hobby. Our first wine was a Rhubarb Raspberry wine, a recipe given to
        us by a family friend. As "homemade" wines go it was really strong and not all that good. And so we quit making wine.
        Then in 1990, a gentleman invited us to his vineyard and taught us how to make wine. And so here we are on the farm
        where 3 generations have lived creating a business out of our love to make wine. We are primarily a fruit winery
        as this is what we know.
